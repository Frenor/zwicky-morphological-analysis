Generalised Morphological Analysis
-----------------------------------

This simple package allows `Morphological analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_analysis>`_,
that is the elimination of contradictory statements from a large set of possibilities.

A good introduction is `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4zAniSP0FY>`_.

As an example, the `Zebra puzzle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle>` is implemented.

The code is a simple depth-first search with early truncation.

See zebra.py for an example.
